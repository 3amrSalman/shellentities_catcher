# Anti- Financial Crime and Know Your Client Decision Support System using Bayesian Network (AFC KYC DSS BN)
Financial establishments such as banks and credit unions are required by law to demonstrate the robustness of its anti-money laundering and compliance programmes to the regulators in fighting financial crimes, and in the digital economy the modernization of client identification, what is known as know your client (KYC) and customer due diligence (CDD) framework, has become a fundamental requirement for maintaining financial integrity and ensuring smooth business operations. While KYC/CDD is a comprehensive term that includes all types of clients, the focus in this repository is on the corporate clients segment and especially on what is called anonymous shell entities. This repository demonstrates probabilistic decision support systems for the detection of the anonymous shell companies in the KYC/CDD process based on a Bayesian network decision support system and implemented in Python using the pgmpy library. The system is designed to assist analysts uncovering financial crime attempts and the perpetrators behind these entities.
